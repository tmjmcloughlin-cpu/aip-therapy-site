- Tom asked me to remember this LinkedIn/blog topic idea: **"Google SERPs: 2006 vs 2016 vs 2026 (and a completely irresponsible 2036)"**.

- Confirmed OpenClaw gateway service is already auto-start enabled + active via systemd on startup.
- Helped complete SnowFox Digital LinkedIn Company Page fields via browser relay:
  - About/overview set
  - Website URL set to https://snowfox.crd.co
  - Specialties added (Local SEO, Technical SEO, Google Business Profile, Website Design, Lead Generation)
  - Buttons confirmed: Message ON, Custom button ON, label "Visit website", URL https://snowfox.crd.co
  - Tagline final target text provided: "SEO & websites for UK service businesses that want qualified leads, not vanity traffic."
- Blogger work completed on post "Google SERPs: 2006 vs 2016 vs 2026 (and a completely irresponsible 2036)":
  - Reworked unclear sections (especially 2036)
  - Replaced weak action block with clearer sequencing/action section
  - Added visible table borders
  - Added service promotion CTA + link to https://snowfox.crd.co
- Gmail integration set up and verified using reused OAuth client:
  - Account connected: tmjmcloughlin@gmail.com
  - Scripts added under tools/gmail (auth/check)
  - Ran inbox cleanup sweeps for old unread promotions/noisy senders/social
- User created GitHub account/repo: https://github.com/tmjmcloughlin-cpu/aip-therapy-site
- Built v1 static HTML prototype for AIP Therapy site at projects/aip-therapy-site with pages:
  - index.html, aip-therapy.html, about.html, contact.html, styles.css
  - Ready to push to repo and then iterate before Wix build.
- Git push blocker identified: user attempted commands in Windows PowerShell where `git` is not installed and Linux workspace path `/home/...` is inaccessible from native PS.
- Resolution given: enter WSL first (`wsl`), then run git commands from `/home/tmclo_x108b9w/.openclaw/workspace/projects/aip-therapy-site`.
