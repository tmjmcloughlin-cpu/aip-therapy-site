# Install the High-End Magazine Blogger Theme

Theme file:
- `tools/blogger/high-end-magazine-theme.xml`

## Steps

1. Open Blogger and select your blog:
   - https://tom-mcloughlin.blogspot.com/
2. Go to **Theme**.
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to **Customize**.
4. Choose **Backup** (optional but recommended).
5. Choose **Restore / Upload**.
6. Upload `high-end-magazine-theme.xml`.
7. Refresh the blog and check:
   - homepage layout
   - single post page
   - mobile view

## If Blogger rejects upload

Some Blogger accounts are stricter with custom XML includes. If upload fails, send me the exact error text and I’ll patch the XML to your account’s parser requirements.
