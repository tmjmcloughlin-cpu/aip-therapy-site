<h2>AEO in 2026 (UK): the playbook for winning answer boxes and AI summaries</h2>

<p>AEO in 2026 is about <strong>format discipline</strong>. Not “write more content”. Not “add more keywords”. It’s: structure information so a machine can extract the answer confidently, then give the user a reason to continue.</p>

<h3>The 4 layers you’re optimising for</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Classic blue links</strong> (still matters)</li>
  <li><strong>Featured snippets</strong> (direct answers)</li>
  <li><strong>People Also Ask</strong> (question expansion)</li>
  <li><strong>AI summary layers</strong> (where Google/others summarise)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Answer-first structure (copy this)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>One-sentence definition</strong> (what is it?)</li>
  <li><strong>40–80 word answer block</strong> (direct, complete, plain English)</li>
  <li><strong>3–7 bullet steps</strong> (if it’s a process)</li>
  <li><strong>Examples</strong> (UK context, costs, edge cases)</li>
  <li><strong>Next-step CTA</strong> (what should they do now?)</li>
</ol>

<h3>What wins in the UK specifically</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clear pricing expectations (ranges are fine)</li>
  <li>Compliance/professional signals where relevant (accreditations, standards)</li>
  <li>Location clarity (where you operate, response times, service areas)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to choose AEO targets (stop guessing)</h3>
<p>Open Search Console and look for queries that are already close:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Positions 4–15</li>
  <li>High impressions, low CTR</li>
  <li>Question-based phrasing: what/why/how/can/should</li>
</ul>

<p>Then rewrite the page to be answer-first. One page at a time. Measured weekly.</p>
