<h2>AEO in 2026: how to win ‘answer’ queries (without writing fluff)</h2>

<p>AEO is not “write shorter”. It’s: structure your content so Google can confidently extract the answer, then give the user a reason to click for the next step.</p>

<h3>What AEO wins look like in 2026</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Featured snippets</li>
  <li>People Also Ask</li>
  <li>AI summary layers (where available)</li>
  <li>How-to steps and checklists</li>
</ul>

<h3>The format that works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Put a 40–80 word answer block near the top</li>
  <li>Use clear headings that match the question</li>
  <li>Follow with examples, edge cases, and UK-specific context</li>
  <li>Close with a practical CTA: what should they do next?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stop trying to AEO everything</h3>
<p>Use AEO where it matches intent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>definitions (“what is…”)</li>
  <li>cost expectations</li>
  <li>comparisons</li>
  <li>process steps</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a fast AEO audit, pick your top 10 queries in Search Console and rewrite the matching sections to be answer-first.</p>
