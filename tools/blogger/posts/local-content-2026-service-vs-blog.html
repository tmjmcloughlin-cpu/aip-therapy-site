<h2>Local SEO content in 2026: service pages vs blog posts</h2>

<p>If you’re a local business, the fastest path to results in 2026 is usually:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Fix and strengthen service pages</strong> first</li>
  <li>Use blog posts to <strong>support</strong> those pages</li>
</ol>

<h3>When service pages win</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High-intent searches: “&lt;service&gt; in &lt;town&gt;”, “near me”, “cost”, “book”</li>
  <li>They convert directly</li>
  <li>They’re easier to map to revenue</li>
</ul>

<h3>When blog posts win</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You need topical authority (Google wants evidence you know the space)</li>
  <li>You want to rank for problem-led queries (“why does X happen”, “is X normal”, “how to…”) </li>
  <li>You need content to earn links and mentions naturally</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 2026 content structure that works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2–4 core service pages (money pages)</li>
  <li>6–12 supporting posts that answer common questions</li>
  <li>Internal links from every support post → the matching service page</li>
</ul>

<p>Rule of thumb: if you can’t clearly say which service page a blog post supports, it’s probably not the right post to publish yet.</p>
