<h2>SEO vs GEO vs AEO in 2026 (UK): what’s changed, what hasn’t</h2>

<p>People are arguing about acronyms again. Fine. Here’s the practical way I think about it in 2026:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SEO</strong> = get found in Google’s traditional results (pages + products + local packs).</li>
  <li><strong>AEO</strong> (Answer Engine Optimisation) = win the <em>answer</em> layer: featured snippets, “People also ask”, AI Overviews style summaries, and any SERP element that tries to finish the query without a click.</li>
  <li><strong>GEO</strong> (Generative Engine Optimisation) = get <em>recommended</em> by AI search assistants and LLM-powered discovery: “best X for Y”, comparison queries, tool lists, vendor recommendations, and brand mentions that drive action.</li>
</ul>

<p>Different surfaces. Same reality: the winner is the business that looks <strong>real, specific, and trustworthy</strong>.</p>

<h3>What hasn’t changed (this is still 80% of the game)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Relevance</strong>: do you clearly match the query and intent?</li>
  <li><strong>Authority</strong>: do trusted sources mention you, cite you, and link to you?</li>
  <li><strong>Trust</strong>: would a human believe your site and your offer?</li>
  <li><strong>Usability</strong>: can someone act (call / book / buy) without friction?</li>
</ul>

<h3>What’s changed in 2026 (where people are getting caught out)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Generic content is filtered harder.</strong> If your page could be swapped with 50 competitors, you’re not building anything Google (or AI) wants to recommend.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity signals matter more.</strong> Consistent brand details, real-world signals, and clear topical focus beat “SEO trick” pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Answers steal demand.</strong> You need to structure pages so you can win the answer box <em>and</em> still earn the click for deeper intent.</li>
  <li><strong>Brand-led search increases.</strong> People are increasingly searching for “the one they’ve heard of”. GEO is as much positioning as it is optimisation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The UK angle: what I’d do first for a local business</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Fix your core service pages (clear offer + pricing expectations + proof).</li>
  <li>Lock in Google Business Profile hygiene and review velocity.</li>
  <li>Build one <strong>credible</strong> content hub (FAQs / guides) that supports your money pages.</li>
  <li>Earn local mentions (partnerships, sponsorships, associations) that exist outside SEO.</li>
  <li>Track a weekly scorecard so you can prove movement.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want, I can turn this into a repeatable system: one monthly plan, one weekly scorecard, and a content pipeline that supports SEO + AEO + GEO at the same time.</p>
