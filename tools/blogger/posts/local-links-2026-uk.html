<h2>Local links in 2026: safe authority building for UK businesses</h2>

<p>Local link building in 2026 is less about “guest posts” and more about earning real mentions in places your customers already trust.</p>

<h3>What still works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Local sponsorships (sports clubs, charities) with a real website mention</li>
  <li>Local partnerships (suppliers, complementary services)</li>
  <li>Industry memberships/directories that are legitimate</li>
  <li>Local PR: actual newsworthy stories, not SEO press release farms</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to avoid</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Paid link networks</li>
  <li>Low-quality “business directories” with no traffic</li>
  <li>Exact-match anchor spam</li>
</ul>

<h3>A UK-friendly link plan</h3>
<ol>
  <li>List 20 local orgs you genuinely engage with</li>
  <li>Offer something valuable (talk, workshop, sponsorship, resource)</li>
  <li>Ask for a mention on their site (not “a backlink”)</li>
</ol>

<p>Authority compounds, but only if it’s real.</p>
