<h2>GEO in 2026: how to get recommended by AI search (without ‘AI content spam’)</h2>

<p>If SEO is about ranking, GEO is about being <strong>recommended</strong>. That recommendation tends to go to brands that feel real: specific positioning, proof, and consistent signals across the web.</p>

<h3>What actually drives AI recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity</strong>: who you help, what you do, where you do it</li>
  <li><strong>Proof</strong>: reviews, case studies, testimonials, outcomes</li>
  <li><strong>Consensus</strong>: multiple trusted sources saying the same thing about you</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: name/offer/details match everywhere (site, socials, directories)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The easy GEO wins</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create one “best page” per core topic (not ten thin pages)</li>
  <li>Write comparison content where you can be the obvious choice</li>
  <li>Get mentioned by real organisations (local/industry) — not link farms</li>
  <li>Make your author/company identity explicit (who is behind this?)</li>
</ul>

<h3>GEO isn’t separate from SEO — it’s the same credibility, expressed differently</h3>
<p>If a human wouldn’t recommend you after reading your site, an AI assistant shouldn’t either. Build for humans first, then structure it so machines can verify it.</p>
