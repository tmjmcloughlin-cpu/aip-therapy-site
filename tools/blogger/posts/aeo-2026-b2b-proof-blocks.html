<h2>AEO for B2B service pages (2026): proof blocks that earn the click</h2>

<p>Winning the answer is only half the job. B2B buyers still click when they need proof. Here are the proof blocks that work in 2026.</p>

<h3>Proof block 1: outcomes (not activities)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Before/after metrics</li>
  <li>Time-to-impact</li>
  <li>Constraints (so it’s believable)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proof block 2: process transparency</h3>
<p>Buyers want to know what happens after “yes”. A clear process section reduces perceived risk.</p>

<h3>Proof block 3: credible specificity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Who you’ve worked with (where appropriate)</li>
  <li>What you specialise in</li>
  <li>What you won’t do</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proof block 4: FAQs that handle objections</h3>
<p>Answer the awkward questions: price, timelines, what’s required from the client, what happens if it doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Build these blocks once and you’ll convert better <em>and</em> give machines more confidence in your credibility.</p>
