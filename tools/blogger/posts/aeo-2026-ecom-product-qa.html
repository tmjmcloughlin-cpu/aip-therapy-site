<h2>AEO for ecommerce (2026): product Q&amp;A that actually ranks</h2>

<p>Ecommerce AEO in 2026 is about removing uncertainty at the moment of purchase. Product Q&amp;A can rank, but only if it’s structured and genuinely useful.</p>

<h3>What to answer (prioritise these)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Compatibility: will it work with X?</li>
  <li>Sizing/fit (with examples)</li>
  <li>Shipping/returns (clear and UK-specific)</li>
  <li>Care/maintenance</li>
  <li>Differences between variants</li>
</ul>

<h3>Format</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short direct answer first</li>
  <li>Then detail, then links to specs/policies</li>
  <li>Use consistent headings (machines love consistency)</li>
</ul>

<p>Done properly, Q&amp;A reduces returns and increases conversion — and that’s the real win.</p>
