<h2>AEO for local businesses (2026): how to turn FAQs into enquiries</h2>

<p>Most local sites treat FAQs like filler. In 2026, a good FAQ section is an AEO asset <em>and</em> a conversion asset — if you write it properly.</p>

<h3>Rule #1: every FAQ must map to an intent stage</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem awareness</strong>: “Is X normal?”, “Why does X happen?”</li>
  <li><strong>Solution awareness</strong>: “How does X work?”, “What happens in a session/visit?”</li>
  <li><strong>Cost/risk</strong>: “How much is it?”, “Are there side effects?”, “How long does it take?”</li>
  <li><strong>Local proof</strong>: “Do you cover &lt;area&gt;?”, “Parking/access”, “Urgent appointments”</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rule #2: answer in 60 seconds</h3>
<p>Give a direct 40–80 word answer first. Then add detail underneath.</p>

<h3>Rule #3: bake in the conversion pathway</h3>
<ul>
  <li>End each answer with a next step: call/book/check availability</li>
  <li>Link to the relevant service page (not your homepage)</li>
  <li>Use UK language and expectations (timescales, pricing ranges, what’s typical)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do this well and you get the double win: more visibility for question queries and fewer time-wasting enquiries because expectations are set upfront.</p>
