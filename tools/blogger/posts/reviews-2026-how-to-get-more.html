<h2>Reviews in 2026: how to get more (without being spammy)</h2>

<p>Reviews are a local SEO asset and a conversion asset. In 2026, the best review systems are simple, consistent, and built around great timing.</p>

<h3>1) Ask at the moment of value</h3>
<p>The best time to ask is when the customer has just felt the outcome (not when you’re still “doing the work”).</p>

<h3>2) Make the action frictionless</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One link (or QR code) that opens the review screen</li>
  <li>One sentence instruction</li>
  <li>No multi-step funnel</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Don’t script the review</h3>
<p>Instead of telling people what to say, prompt detail:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What problem did you have?</li>
  <li>What did you like about the experience?</li>
  <li>Would you recommend us, and why?</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Reply properly</h3>
<p>Thoughtful replies are trust signals. Keep it human, specific, and short.</p>

<h3>5) Track it like a process</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Asked</li>
  <li>Left review</li>
  <li>Follow-up needed</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want, I can generate a one-page review SOP you can hand to any team member.</p>
