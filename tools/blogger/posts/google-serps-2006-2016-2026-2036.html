<h2>Google SERPs: 2006 vs 2016 vs 2026 (and a completely irresponsible 2036)</h2>

<p><em>Note: You asked for “in the style of Scott Adams / Dilbert future”. I can’t imitate a living author’s exact style. What I <strong>can</strong> do is write this with a sharp, corporate-cartoon-ish voice: deadpan, systems-thinking, mildly allergic to buzzwords, and slightly too aware of how incentives break everything.</em></p>

<p>If you want to understand SEO, AEO and GEO in 2026, don’t start with the latest acronym. Start with a time machine.</p>

<p>Because Google’s results page didn’t just “change design”. It changed <strong>business model</strong>, <strong>user expectations</strong> and <strong>what a click is worth</strong>.</p>

<h3>2006: “Ten blue links” era (plus the early ad gravity)</h3>

<p>In 2006, the SERP was a fairly honest interface: type words, get pages. Ads existed, but the page still <em>felt</em> like it was there to send you away to the web.</p>

<p>The optimisation checklist was boring (which is why it worked):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Put the keyword in the right places.</li>
  <li>Get links from relevant sites.</li>
  <li>Don’t be broken.</li>
</ul>

<p>The hidden game: Google was learning that a SERP is a money printer when the intent is commercial. Which means the “ten blue links” era was always living on borrowed time.</p>

<hr>

<h3>2016: “Results page as product” era</h3>

<p>By 2016, the SERP wasn’t a list of exits. It was a <strong>destination</strong>. You could often get what you needed without clicking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Local packs (Maps)</li>
  <li>Knowledge panels (entities)</li>
  <li>Featured snippets / PAA</li>
  <li>More aggressive ad layouts (especially on mobile)</li>
</ul>

<p>If 2006 SEO was “rank a page”, 2016 SEO was “rank a page <em>and</em> survive the stuff Google put above you”.</p>

<p>And this is where the modern job roles started splitting:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SEO</strong>: win the classic results.</li>
  <li><strong>AEO</strong>: win the answers (snippets / PAA).</li>
  <li><strong>Local</strong>: win the map layer.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>2026: “Answer, compare, recommend, transact” era</h3>

<p>In 2026, the SERP behaves like an operating system. It’s trying to complete the user’s job with minimal friction and maximum monetisable surface area.</p>

<p>So the competition is not “other websites”. It’s:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google’s own answer layers</li>
  <li>Google’s own local layer</li>
  <li>Marketplaces (if your category has them)</li>
  <li>Content that looks more credible than yours</li>
</ul>

<p>Which means the winning play is boring again:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be specific.</li>
  <li>Be provable.</li>
  <li>Be structured.</li>
  <li>Be consistent everywhere, not just on your website.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Chart 1: “How much of the SERP is trying to steal the click?” (illustrative)</h4>
<p><small>Not scientific. It’s a vibes-based chart. But the vibe is correct.</small></p>
<pre>
2006  | Answer layers: ██░░░░░░░░  (20%)
2016  | Answer layers: █████░░░░░  (50%)
2026  | Answer layers: ████████░░  (80%)
2036* | Answer layers: ██████████  (100%)
</pre>

<h4>What AEO/GEO mean in 2026 (practical definition)</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AEO</strong>: your content is structured so Google can extract the answer confidently.</li>
  <li><strong>GEO</strong>: your brand/entity is credible enough to be recommended by generative systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>SEO didn’t die. It got absorbed into a bigger truth: the thing ranking is no longer “a page”. It’s an <strong>entity</strong> with a track record.</p>

<hr>

<h3>2036 (for fun): “Search as your manager” era</h3>

<p>Here’s my 2036 prediction: you won’t search; you’ll delegate. The UI will be a conversation that quietly turns into a purchase order.</p>

<p>Which means the true ranking factors will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can the system verify you are real?</li>
  <li>Can it verify you deliver outcomes?</li>
  <li>Can it route the transaction with minimal risk?</li>
</ul>

<p>And somewhere a senior exec will say, “We’re improving the user experience,” which will be technically true, in the same way that a bear improves the camping experience by ending it quickly.</p>

<h3>Charts you can actually use (2026 action plan)</h3>

<h4>Chart 2: where to invest time (UK business edition)</h4>
<pre>
Impact vs Effort (rough)

High impact, low effort:
- Fix your top 2 money pages
- GBP hygiene + reviews
- Internal linking from support content to money pages

High impact, higher effort:
- Credible proof assets (case studies, outcomes, comparisons)
- Real mentions/partnerships
- Structured data where it genuinely fits

Low impact distractions (usually):
- Publishing 30 thin blogs
- Chasing every new feature without measurement

<p><strong>If you want the punchline:</strong> every year Google gets better at answering. Every year businesses have to get better at being worth recommending.</p>
