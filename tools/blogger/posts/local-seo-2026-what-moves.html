<h2>Local SEO in 2026: what actually moves the needle</h2>

<p>Local SEO hasn’t become “more complicated” in 2026 — it’s become more <em>selective</em>. Google is better at filtering out templated pages, thin location spam, and low-trust businesses. The upside is: if you do the fundamentals properly, results are often faster than people expect.</p>

<h3>1) Your Google Business Profile is a ranking system, not a directory listing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Choose the right <strong>primary category</strong> (this is the biggest lever inside GBP).</li>
  <li>Fill <strong>services</strong> properly (not keyword soup — real services with clear names).</li>
  <li>Post <strong>real updates</strong> (offers, FAQs, case notes) on a cadence you can maintain.</li>
  <li>Keep your <strong>photos</strong> current: storefront/office, team, before/after, work in progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) One great service page beats ten “SEO pages”</h3>
<p>In 2026, Google rewards pages that answer the query completely. For local businesses, that means a service page that clearly covers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who the service is for (and who it’s not for)</li>
  <li>What happens during the service / your process</li>
  <li>Pricing or price ranges (and what affects price)</li>
  <li>Trust signals: qualifications, memberships, insurance, reviews, case studies</li>
  <li>Local proof: where you operate, how quickly you can get to the area, local landmarks</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Reviews are your conversion engine (and an SEO signal)</h3>
<p>Reviews impact clicks even when they don’t directly “rank” you. In practical terms, reviews increase <strong>CTR</strong> from Maps and local packs, which can amplify your visibility.</p>

<h3>4) Internal linking is the quiet multiplier</h3>
<p>Most local sites have the pages, but they aren’t connected. Build obvious pathways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homepage → core services</li>
  <li>Core services → related services (“also helps with…”)</li>
  <li>Blog posts → service pages (“If you need help with X in Y, here’s the service”)</li>
</ul>

<h3>5) Measurement: keep it simple, keep it weekly</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Search Console: clicks, impressions, top queries, top pages</li>
  <li>GBP: calls, direction requests, website clicks</li>
  <li>Leads: calls + form fills (and quality notes)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you want a local SEO plan built for your business in 2026</strong>, start with: your top 2 services, your main location, and your current enquiry method. The rest is execution.</p>
