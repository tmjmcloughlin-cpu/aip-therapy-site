<h2>Local SEO in 2026: what actually moves the needle (UK)</h2>

<p>Local SEO hasn’t become “mystical” in 2026 — it’s just less tolerant of lazy execution. If you’re a UK local business, here’s what reliably drives results.</p>

<h3>1) One great service page beats ten “SEO pages”</h3>
<p>Pick your top service and build one page that a customer would genuinely trust:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What you do (plain English)</li>
  <li>Who it’s for / who it isn’t for</li>
  <li>Pricing expectations (ranges are fine)</li>
  <li>Proof: reviews, case notes, before/after, credentials, guarantees</li>
  <li>Local coverage: the towns you actually serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Google Business Profile is still a ranking system</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Correct primary category</li>
  <li>Services filled properly</li>
  <li>Fresh photos</li>
  <li>Posts you can maintain</li>
  <li>Consistent NAP across the web</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Reviews: the compounding lever</h3>
<p>Reviews improve conversions and often lift CTR in Maps/local packs. Make review collection a process, not a hope.</p>

<h3>4) Local authority that isn’t “SEO link building”</h3>
<p>Sponsorships, associations, partnerships, local PR. If it would still make sense without Google, it’s probably a good idea.</p>

<h3>5) Track weekly, decide monthly</h3>
<ul>
  <li>GSC: clicks, impressions, top pages, top queries</li>
  <li>GBP: calls, website clicks, direction requests</li>
  <li>Leads: count + quality notes</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the work. The rest is just consistency.</p>
