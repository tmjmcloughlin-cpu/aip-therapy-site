<h2>AEO for ecommerce category pages (2026): answer sections without thin content</h2>

<p>Category pages are hard: you want an answer section, but you don’t want a 1,000-word essay that no one reads.</p>

<h3>The category AEO pattern</h3>
<ul>
  <li>40–80 word “what is this category for?” block</li>
  <li>3–5 buyer questions answered (bullets)</li>
  <li>1 comparison: “how to choose” criteria</li>
  <li>Links to deeper guides (blog) for long answers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keep it honest</h3>
<p>If you don’t stock a thing, say so. If shipping takes longer for bulky items, say so. In 2026, credibility beats “optimised copy”.</p>
