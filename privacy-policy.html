<section class="section alt"><div class="container card">
<p><strong>(In line with the BACP Ethical Framework and UK GDPR)</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information with care, transparency and respect. This practice complies with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
<p>GDPR exists to ensure that your personal and sensitive data is:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li>Collected lawfully and fairly</li>
<li>Stored securely</li>
<li>Used only for agreed and legitimate purposes</li>
<li>Kept for no longer than necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal data may include your name, contact details, health information, session notes, emails, text messages and any other information that could identify you. Full details of our data protection policy are available on request.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section"><div class="container card">
<h2>What information do we collect and why?</h2>
<p>We collect and store only the information necessary to provide a safe, ethical and effective counselling service. This may include:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li>Personal contact details</li>
<li>Relevant medical or mental health information</li>
<li>Information about significant relationships</li>
<li>Brief session notes</li>
</ul>
<p>This information helps us:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li>Provide continuity and quality of care</li>
<li>Work ethically and professionally</li>
<li>Meet our legal, insurance and professional obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Your GP or other professional details will only be used with your explicit written consent.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section alt"><div class="container card">
<h2>How long is information kept?</h2>
<p>In line with professional indemnity insurance requirements, BACP guidance, and NHS record retention guidelines:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li>Adult client records are kept for 7 years after the final session</li>
<li>Children’s records are kept until the client’s 25th birthday</li>
<li>If therapy ends when a young person is aged 17, records are kept until their 26th birthday</li>
</ul>
<p>All records are securely destroyed in the January following the end of the relevant retention period.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section"><div class="container card">
<h2>Your right to request deletion</h2>
<p>Under GDPR, you have the right to request the deletion of your records. Requests must be made in writing.</p>
<p>If approved:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li>Paper records will be cross-shredded</li>
<li>Electronic data (emails, texts, digital files) will be permanently deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>We are required to retain a record of your deletion request. In some circumstances, we may be legally required to retain certain information (for example, due to insurance or legal obligations). If this applies, we will explain this clearly to you.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section alt"><div class="container card">
<h2>How your information is stored securely</h2>
<p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li>Paper records: Stored in a locked cabinet within a locked room</li>
<li>Mobile phones: Secured with passcodes</li>
<li>Emails and digital records: Password protected</li>

</div></section>

<section class="section"><div class="container card">
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Confidentiality is a core part of the therapeutic relationship and is upheld in accordance with the BACP Ethical Framework.</p>
<p>Everything discussed in sessions is confidential. We may occasionally discuss aspects of our work in clinical supervision to ensure best practice and client safety. These discussions are anonymised, and supervisors are also bound by confidentiality and data protection requirements.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section alt"><div class="container card">
<h2>Seeing each other outside sessions</h2>
<p>If we encounter one another outside of sessions, we will not initiate conversation in order to protect your confidentiality. You are free to acknowledge or disclose your therapy to others if you choose; however, we will not do so.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section"><div class="container card">
<h2>Sharing information with other professionals</h2>
<p>Any communication with other health or social care professionals (such as your GP) will only take place with your written, informed consent, unless there is a legal or safeguarding requirement to do otherwise.</p>
</div></section>

<section class="section alt"><div class="container card">
<h2>Exceptions to confidentiality and data protection</h2>
<p>There are rare circumstances where confidentiality may need to be breached:</p>
<ul class="list-clean">
<li><strong>Risk of serious harm:</strong> If you disclose an intention to seriously harm yourself or others, we have a legal and ethical duty of care to share relevant information with appropriate services to protect life. Wherever possible, this will be discussed with you first.</li>
<li><strong>Legal requirement:</strong> If we receive a court order, police warrant, or other legal demand, we are required by law to provide the requested information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any disclosure will be limited to what is necessary and handled with care.</p>
